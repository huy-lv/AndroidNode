## Run Node on Android
This project will download a nodejs file from server and execute it locally using [NodeJS mobile](https://github.com/nodejs-mobile/nodejs-mobile)

1. Open app
2. In the webview, edit js code and press save
3. Press `Download and execute node function` button 
4. View the result below

### Note
Currently, only a single instance of the Node.js runtime can be started within an application. Restarting the engine after it has finished running is also not supported. So you have to restart app after executing node function.
